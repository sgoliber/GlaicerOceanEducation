#Code from the Simple Ice tool on Ghub
https://theghub.org/tools/simpleice


This tool shows how a simple glacier model changes in response to changes in the ocean. It includes several interactive animations of real model output. The goal is to teach students the complex interaction between glaciers and the ocean, as well as basic graph interpretation.

 

The model output is derived from a modified version of Alexander Robel's model code. Original code can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/5245271.

 

This module includes Glacier and Ocean Change Lecture notes to accompany the tool and it is assumed that students have review these slides before using the tool. Guided questions for this notebook can also be found on here. All users can feel free to copy and share the lecture and question sheet and adapt/change as needed!

 

Please contact Sophie Goliber (sophiego@buffalo.edu) if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for changed.
